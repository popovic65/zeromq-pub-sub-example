# zeromq-pub-sub-example
Node.js zeroMQ publisher-subscriber example. It has four services: send mail, send sms , fork and worker threads processes to calculate sum.

### How to run the app:
First run:
```
npm install
```
to install all the node modules. Create .env file, after that use nodemon to start publisher and services you want.
I suggest to use split terminal.
